# Read raw image from camera

## Installation
If you wish to use `dcraw.exe` instead of the build in libraw library you will need to put the executable `dcraw.exe`
into the directory that contains the Magick.NET dll. The zip file `ImageMagick-7.X.X-X-Q16-x86-windows.zip`
that you can download from http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php#windows contains this file.
To force the use of dcraw the `Format` in the `MagickReadSettings` should be set to `MagickFormat.Dcraw`.

## Convert CR2 to JPG

```C#
using (MagickImage image = new MagickImage("StillLife.CR2"))
{
    image.Write("StillLife.jpg");
}
```
